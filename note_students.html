		<div class="content">
			
			I get lots emails from potential students that unfortunately I am unable to reply to all. Just because I don't reply doesn't mean I don't read your email or consider your application. I answer some frequent questions here:
			
			<h4 id="news">Apply for PhD Program</h4>
			
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Will you be accepting new students for the year 201X?</h6>
			A: Yes, I plan to take one or two new phd students every year. I have research funding and can also support applicants through department/university fellowship and TA-ship. The admission committee and I will look at the applications, and we usually start making offers in March every year. 

			<h6 id="news">Q: Is there anything special I should do when I apply? </h6>
			A: Yes! If you want to work with me, be sure to list my name in your application. If in doubt, email me after you've completed your application, I can check to ensure you show up in the system. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Could I do summer internships during phd? </h6>
			A: I encourage phd students to do one or two summer internships to gain more research experience. 

			
			<h6 id="news">Q: What is life like in Columbus Ohio? </h6>
			A: Columbus is the 14th-largest city in the United States. It has an art scene with <a href="http://www.columbusunderground.com/events/">concerts, gallery events</a> and constant changing art exhibitions at <a href="https://pizzuticollection.org/">Pizzuti</a>, <a href="http://www.wexarts.org/">Wexner</a> and Columbus Museum of Art. Lots of <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Columbus">good restaurants</a> of different cuisines, boutique <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=latte&find_loc=Columbus,+OH">coffee shops</a> and speciality grocery stores (Japanese, Chinese, etc). The Olentangy river trail that goes through OSU campus is good for running and biking to office. Short direct flights or drives to Chicago, New York, Washington DC, Denver, Toronto, and other places for weekend getaways.

			<h4 id="news">For undergraduate, masters, phd students already at OSU</h4>
			<h6 id="news">Q: Can you advise me on research or be my advisor?</h6>
			A: Send me an email with your resume. My main interest is in natural language processing. You may learn more about my research on my <a href="./index.html">homepage</a> and through my <a href="./index.html#publications">publications</a>. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Would you work with undergraduate and masters students?</h6>
			A: Yes! In fact, four undergraduate and two masters students have published research papers with me (often as 1st author). Four of them were admitted to top CS graduate schools afterwards (UIUC, UWashington, CMU), while others got full-time jobs at Microsoft and Holu.com. I recruit undergraduate and masters students primarily from the <a href="./index.html#teach">classes I teach</a>.
