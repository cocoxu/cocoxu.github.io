			<h4><strong>Notes to Prospective Students</strong></h4>

		</div>




		<div class="content">
			
			I answer some frequent questions here:
			
			<h4 id="news">Apply for PhD Program</h4>
			
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Will you be accepting new students for the year 201X?</h6>
			A: Yes, I take new PhD students every year. Here is a <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/prospective-students/cse-graduate-admissions">link</a> describing how to apply. We usually start making offers in March every year. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Are the PhD positions funded?</h6>
			A: Yes, I have research funding and can also support applicants through department/university fellowship and TA-ship. PhD students will be fully funded (including tuition, fees, and a monthly stipend ranging from $1,625 - $1,860). As rent is about $600 - $800 for a studio near campus, many students can also afford owning a car. 

			<h6 id="news">Q: Is there anything special I should do when I apply? </h6>
			A: Yes! If you want to work with me, be sure to list my name in your application. If in doubt, email me after you've completed your application, I can check to ensure you show up in the system. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Could I do summer internships during phd? </h6>
			A: Internship is a good opportunity to gain research experience. I encourage phd students to do one or two internships. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: What computing servers do your group use? </h6>
			A: My students usually use the clusters (over 100 nodes with NVIDIA Pascal P100 and Tesla M2070 GPUs) at Ohio Supercomputer Center for running deep learning models. We also have two in-house GPU and CPU servers. 

			
			<h6 id="news">Q: What is life like in Columbus Ohio and OSU? </h6>
			A: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio">Columbus</a> is the 14th-largest city in the United States. It has an art scene with <a href="http://www.columbusunderground.com/events/">concerts, gallery events</a>, and constantly changing art exhibitions at <a href="https://pizzuticollection.org/">Pizzuti</a>, <a href="http://www.wexarts.org/">Wexner</a> and Columbus Museum of Art. The zoo and botanical garden are among the best rated in U.S. Lots of <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=Restaurants&find_loc=Columbus">good restaurants</a> of different cuisines, microbreweries, <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/mouton-columbus">cocktail bars</a>, boutique <a href="https://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=latte&find_loc=Columbus,+OH">coffee shops</a> and speciality grocery stores (Japanese, Chinese, etc). The Olentangy river trail that goes through OSU campus is good for running and biking to office. OSU is a <a href="https://recsports.osu.edu/facilities">super sporty school</a>; gym and the football stadium are right next to CS building. I also like the <a href="http://gatewayfilmcenter.org/">independent movie theater</a> on campus. Short direct flights to Chicago, New York, Washington DC, Denver (<a href="http://coloradoski.com/resorts">world-class skiing</a> & hiking), Toronto and Philadelphia for weekend getaways or commutes; driving distance to Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Lake Erie and other places. 

             
<br><br>
			
			<h4 id="news">For undergraduate, masters, phd students already at OSU</h4>
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Can you advise me on research or be my advisor?</h6>
			A: Send me an email with your resume. My main interest is in natural language processing. You may learn more about my research on my <a href="./index.html">homepage</a> and through my <a href="./index.html#publications">publications</a>. I also recommend reading Jason Eisner's <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/advice/how-to-work-with-a-professor.html"> advice</a> to students who want to work with a professor. 
			
			<h6 id="news">Q: Would you work with undergraduate and masters students?</h6>
			A: Yes! In fact, several undergraduate and masters students not only worked but have published research papers with me. Four of them got PhD offers from top universities (UIUC, UWashington, CMU), while others got full-time jobs at Microsoft and Amazon. I primarily recruit undergraduate and masters students from the <a href="./index.html#teach">classes</a> I teach.
