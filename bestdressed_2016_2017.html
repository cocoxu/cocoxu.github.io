			<h5 id="news">Editor's Notes</h5>
			
			The competition for the best dressed list is fierce. The winners are picked from a 2-year period including the record-breaking ACL 2017 with a 1800+ crowd. Good news is that there is only one reviewer (me) other than three reviewers to convince that "your RNN is better than others RNNs". The criteria are: 
			<ul>
			    <li>Appropriateness: Does this outfit fit the conference? </li>
			    <li>Originality: Does this outfit show innovative ideas? Or merely the same as what wore before or wore by others? </li>
			    <li>Soundness: Is the outfit well-chosen to support the author's personality? 
			    
			    </ul>
			
			The growth of NLP conferences and research community provided a lot of more eye candies and excitements. At the same time, conferences become less intimate and more intimidating. It becomes increasingly challenging to young students for their first conferences, so here are my two tips: 
			<br>
			<ul>
			    <li>Stay out of comfort zone! Large conference is not meant to feel comfortable, so if you are doing things you feel extremely uncomfortable then you are likely doing the right thing. If you are students talk to renowned researchers just as an equal, if you are a Chinese student talk to non-Chinese researchers just as the same, etc.; </li>
			    <li>Stay late and hang out! Everyone is just more relaxed and more friendly over dinner, and especially after dinner over drinks (see the <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DE3RhXJXYAQfo2I.jpg:large">infographic</a> Keenan Crane made).</li>
			    
			    
				 
			</ul>
			
			<br>
			</ul>
			The 2015 best dressed list is <a href="bestdressed_2015.html">here</a> and 2014 is <a href="bestdressed.html">here</a>. If you want to nominate someone, please email me at <font color=blue><u>weixu@cse.ohio-state.edu</u></font>. I have also received self-nominations :) and I am definitely taking them into accounts.

			<h5>Top 10 (in alphabetical order):</h5>

			<ul>
			    
				<li><b><a href="http://yoavartzi.com/">Yoav Artzi</a></b> Is Yoav the new Jacob Eisenstein? Unlike Jacob, Yoav is <a href="bestdressed.html">actually</a> living in Brooklyn. He somehow suddently became very stylish after moving to NYC and becoming a professor.</li> 
				<li><b><a href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~eunsol/home.html">Eunsol Choi</a></b> Like advisor <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3432759/WE-NOT-RELATED-Four-Asian-students-stage-brilliant-yearbook-stunt-spell-frustrations-consecutive-portraits.html">like</a> advisee. I really want to know where she gets her skirt, leather jacket, purse and everything (The highest possible true-to-heart compliment I can give to anyone's outfit is -- I want it too!). </li> 
			    <li><b><a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yejin/">Yejin Choi</a></b> It is very hard to get repeated acceptances into the best dressed list as substantially different idea is required. Yejin reinnovated herself this year with a tiger t-shirt!</li> 
			     <li><b><a href="http://www.dhgarrette.com/">Dan Garrette</a></b> Polo shirts and khakis are classic, but easily fall into old-fashioned. Dan pulled the look together with the right belt and pair of shoes. </li>
			    <li><b><a href="http://www.dirkhovy.com/">Dirk Hovy</a></b> He win by a suspension look this time, and he won by a three-piece suit last time. </li> 
			    <li><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zunairajamil/?ppe=1">Zunaira Jamil</a></b> The photo I snapped of her at ACL 2017 speaks for itself.</li>
				<li><b><a href="http://cs.stanford.edu/~jurgens/">David Jurgens</a></b> For my lifeime, I believed that no one can pull off a pink shirt. David made me change my mind. The key seems to be pairing with the ACL best sunglasses.</li>
				<li><b><a href="http://www.colorado.edu/faculty/palmer-martha/">Martha Palmer</a></b> She wore a blue dress with amazingly interesting jewelry at WiNLP, but unfortunately, I lost the moment to snap a shot for you to see. </li>
			    <li><b><a href="http://candaceross.io/">Candace Ross</a></b> The most colorful yet professional outfit I have seen.</li>
				 <li><b><a href="http://jakob.uszkoreit.net/">Jakob Uszkoreit</a></b> Attention is all you need -- with the best hairstyle. His black cotton jacket is also nice and subtle.</li>
				
				 
</ul>
			<h5>Honorable mentions:</h5>

			<ul>	
				<li><b><a href="https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~hal/">Hal Daumé III</a></b> His deep look on Twitter </li> 			 
				<li><b><a href="http://www.ee.ust.hk/~pascale/">Pascale Fung</a></b> Her grey patterned dress at EMNLP 2017 </li> 
				<li><b><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-kramer-2750004b/">Jared Kramer</a></b> His mustache look at COLING 2016 </li> 
				<li><b><a href="http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/k/Kiddon:Chlo=eacute=">Chloé Kiddon</a></b> Her necklace-alternated name badge at EMNLP 2016 </li> 
				<li><b><a href="">David</a></b> and <b><a href="">Noah Smith</a></b> The Smith twins look at NAACL 2016 </li> 
				<li><b><a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/">Bonnie Webber</a></b> Her short hair and jewelry at ACL 2017 and all time</li> 
			</ul>
		
			Let's also remember the most stylish NLP conference ever -- the EMNLP nightclub.
